Dr. Liu is well known for his leadership roles and achievements. He was the Director of the Division of Clinical Science at the NCI in 1996, and Executive Director of the Genomic Institute of Singapore from 2001 to 2012. Thereafter he took on the CEO position at The Jackson Laboratory. In many of these leadership roles, Dr. Liu is responsible for building the institute infrastructure, overseeing budget, managing talent recruitment and directing scientific mission strategic plan. His success in the US and in Singapore, two very distinct culture environments, is remarkable and is very inspiring to members of the SCBA.

After the event, Dr. Liu met with the SCBA chapter senior members and gave advice on leadership opportunities and challenges.
